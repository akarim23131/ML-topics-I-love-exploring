# ML topics I love exploring

The code in the Batch Norm and Kaiming Initialization file is designed to be self-explanatory and can be easily understood by running each cell step by step. Each code cell is clearly written, making it easier for you to follow along and grasp the concepts. I recommend executing the cells in sequence for a better understanding of the underlying processes and logic.
